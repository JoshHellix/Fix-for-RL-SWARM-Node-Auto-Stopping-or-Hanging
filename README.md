# ⚙️ Fix for RL-SWARM Node Auto-Stopping or Hanging
 A quick guide to help you fix the issue where your  "Gensyn RL-SWARM node"  keeps stopping or hanging unexpectedly.   > This follows the official fix shared by the Gensyn Team (Release v0.6.2).
 ---

## 🧩 Overview

If your RL-SWARM node has been **crashing**, **stopping automatically**, or **hanging after a while**,  
there’s now an official patch available that improves type checking and filters out bad actors.

You’ll just need to **upgrade your RL-SWARM setup** to the latest release and **reset your virtual environment**.

---

## 🚀 Steps to Fix

## 1️⃣ Navigate to Your RL-SWARM Directory
```bash
cd ~/rl-swarm
```
Adjust the path if your RL-SWARM folder is elsewhere.

---

## 2️⃣ (Optional) Save Uncommitted Changes
If you’ve modified any files or have uncommitted work, stash them first:
```bash

git stash
```

---

## 3️⃣ Reset and Recreate Your Virtual Environment
Run this single command to clean and rebuild your environment:
```
rm -rf .venv && git pull && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```
✅ This will:

Delete the old .venv (virtual environment)

Pull the latest code from GitHub

Create a fresh .venv

Activate it

---

## 4️⃣ Restart Your Node
After activating your environment, run your node as usual:
```bash

bash run_rl_swarm.sh
```
or, if you’ve made it executable:
```bash

./run_rl_swarm.sh
```

---

## 🧠 Additional Tips
If your node still stops, try checking logs:
```bash

tail -n 50 logs/node.log
```
Ensure your VPS has enough memory and CPU for continuous operation.

Rebooting your VPS before re-running the node can also help clear hung processes.
